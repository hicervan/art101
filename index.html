					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>I am a third year art major at UCSC. I like to draw, specifically in pen and ink. I also enjoy socializing.
						I have a black cat that I named Taco, which doesn't make any sense---- but I was 9 when I got him and tacos were my favorite food at the time. My favorite artist is Hokusai, who is Japanese and made ukiyo-e prints in the edo period. Its very hard for me to pick a fvaorite band, but if I had to choose a top three it would be 1. Bob Dylan 2. Hatsune Miku 3. Death Cab for Cutie.
