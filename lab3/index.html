			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structures</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to help us newbies understand the importance of file structures when coding. This also helped us learn how to code images into a website, and helped me practice more CSS. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Not many problems arose, but my partner Ahmee was there to support me if I needed anything. I was a little confused as to where files were located, and how to type things properly in order to code them into the wesbsite. <3</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I feel like I put adequate energy into this assignment. I enjoyed organizing my files, and I even tried my hand at editing even more CSS!
					</p>
