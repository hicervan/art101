			<h1>Lab 4 - Psuedocoding & Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to take day-to-day tasks and turn them into Js comments.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had problems with typing out my psuedocode and js comments. I didn't know how specific my instructions should/shouldn't be. I was also unsure of how comments should be worded for Js. I wonder even now if any of my comments make sense. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I am a little confused on how this assignment is to help us, but I do hope to learn how to code a Jack-in-the-Box in Java! I am excited to learn java and very nervous about having problems and falling behind. </p>

						  // Generate a handle attached to the side of the square that spins 
						// Allow user to spin handle
						  // After user spins handle 10 times, play noise
